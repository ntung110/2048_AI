# 2048_AI
An AI that plays the game 2048 using the Minimax algorithm

## General
This is a small 2048 AI I wrote for a project at school, which applies the minimax search tree algorithm, web-scraping techniques and score evaluation using different heuristics.
I don't plan to further update the file as of this time. However, I will revisit this project when the time comes.

Currently, I'm not looking for public contributions, but you are welcome to fork the project anyways.

## Instructions
Install bs4 and Selenium with pip
Download and execute the python file
